<div class="mb-4 overflow-y-auto">
	Welcome to <a href="https://moneybag.markets" class="link">moneybag.markets</a>. In this world,
	companies offer public fractional ownership through
	<span class="inline font-bold text-nowrap"><Moneybag class="inline" /> Moneybags</span>, not
	stocks.<br />
	<br />
	These moneybags can be bought and sold on the market, though riskier investors often opt to open these
	moneybags and take whatever's inside.<br />
	<br />
	Your job is to closely monitor the market and get rich by any means necessary.

	<div class="divider"></div>

	<h2 class="text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl">Buying and Selling</h2>
	<br />

	At any point during the game, you may buy or sell moneybags for any companies you've unlocked if
	you have enough <span class="inline text-nowrap"><PigMoney class="inline" /> Coins</span>.<br />
	<br />
	Buying and selling happens at the current market price, indicated by the value above each graph. You
	can also see recent historical high and low values under each graph.<br />
	<br />
	Each company has its own volatility, market update cadence, and value range. Your
	<span class="inline text-nowrap"><Notebook class="inline" /> Notebook</span> at the bottom keeps
	track of the highest and lowest values you've traded each company's moneybag for.

	<div class="divider"></div>

	<h2 class="text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl">Opening Moneybags</h2>
	<br />

	After purchasing a moneybag, you may choose to open it. Opening a moneybag removes it from your
	portfolio and makes it unavailable to be sold back to the market.<br />
	<br />
	Each moneybag has its own reward table, and certain moneybags have ultra-rare
	<strong>powerup</strong> rewards. Your
	<span class="inline text-nowrap"><Notebook class="inline" /> Notebook</span> tracks unlocked
	powerups.

	<div class="divider"></div>

	<h2 class="text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl">Unlocking Companies</h2>
	<br />

	Unlocking companies costs
	<span class="inline text-nowrap"><PigMoney class="inline" /> Coins</span>. Unlocking a company
	requires paying a one-time fee for lifetime access to the company's market.<br />
	<br />
	Companies may be unlocked in any order.

	<div class="divider"></div>

	<h2 class="text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl">Target Demographics</h2>
	<br />

	Each company is categorized as
	<span class="inline text-nowrap"><ShoppingBag class="inline" /> Goods</span>,
	<span class="inline text-nowrap"><Tools class="inline" /> Service</span>, or
	<span class="inline text-nowrap"><Rollercoaster class="inline" /> Establishment</span>.<br />
	<br />
	Each company also caters to one or more demographics. The full list of demographics is
	<span class="inline text-nowrap"><PlayBasketball class="inline" /> Young Adults</span>,
	<span class="inline text-nowrap"><Walk class="inline" /> Middle-Aged</span>,
	<span class="inline text-nowrap"><Old class="inline" /> Retired</span>,
	<span class="inline text-nowrap"><RosetteDiscount class="inline" /> Lower-Class</span>,
	<span class="inline text-nowrap"><Home class="inline" /> Middle-Class</span>, and
	<span class="inline text-nowrap"><Speedboat class="inline" /> Upper-Class</span>.<br />
	<br />

	<div class="divider"></div>

	<h2 class="text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl">News Ticker</h2>
	<br />

	News headlines are always available at the top of the screen. Pay attention to these headlines,
	since they affect the market.<br />
	<br />
	Every so often,
	<span class="inline text-nowrap"><News class="inline" /> Breaking News</span> is added to the
	ticker. The newest headline is always <span class="font-bold">bolded</span> to distinguish it from
	older news.<br />
	<br />
	Headlines can affect individual companies, all companies in a demographic, or all companies of a specific
	category.

	<div class="divider"></div>

	<h2 class="text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl">AI Disclosure</h2>
	<br />

	The author of this website used AI to generate headlines and company information. All companies in
	this game are fictitious.
